Certainly, let's break down the JavaScript code in simple terms.

**1. Event Listener:**

- We have a form on the page with an ID of "changePasswordForm".
- We're listening for a "submit" event on this form. This means that when the user clicks the "Change Password" button within the form, the code inside the `addEventListener` will be executed.

**2. Prevent Default Behavior:**

- `event.preventDefault();` stops the browser from automatically refreshing the page when the form is submitted. This is important because we want to handle the form submission and send data to the backend using JavaScript.

**3. Get User Input:**

- The code retrieves the values entered by the user in the input fields for:
    - Current Password
    - New Password
    - Confirm New Password

**4. Check for Matching New Passwords:**

- It checks if the "New Password" and "Confirm New Password" fields have the same value.
- If they don't match, an alert message is displayed to the user, and the password change process is stopped.

**5. (Simulated) Current Password Validation:**

- **`const isCurrentPasswordValid = true;`**: This line is a placeholder. In a real application, this would involve sending a request to the backend to verify if the entered "Current Password" matches the password stored in the database for the current user.

**6. Send New Password to Backend (if current password is valid):**

- If the current password is valid (or the simulation passes), the code attempts to send the `newPassword` to the backend for updating the user's password.
- It uses the `fetch` function to make an HTTP request to a specific backend URL (e.g., `/api/change-password`).
- The request is sent using the "POST" method.
- The request includes the `newPassword` in the request body as JSON data.
- The code then waits for the response from the backend.

**7. Handle Backend Response:**

- If the backend responds successfully (status code 200), an alert message is displayed to the user indicating that the password has been changed successfully.
- If the backend response indicates an error (e.g., status code 400, 500), an error message is displayed to the user.

**In essence, the code handles the following:**

- Gathering user input for the password change.
- Performing basic validation on the entered passwords.
- Sending the new password to the backend for processing.
- Displaying appropriate messages to the user based on the success or failure of the password change operation.

**Note:**

- This code focuses on the frontend logic. The backend (Spring Boot) is responsible for:
    - Authenticating the user.
    - Verifying the current password against the stored password.
    - Updating the user's password in the database.
    - Returning appropriate responses to the frontend.

I hope this explanation is clearer and more helpful for your communication with your backend developer!
